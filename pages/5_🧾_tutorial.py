                RamanCloud is designed to be a user-friendly and powerful tool for spectral data processing and analysis, especially for Raman spectroscopy.
                The platform is developed by the [Ren Research Group](https://bren.xmu.edu.cn) in Xiamen University.  
                
                You can run this tutorial in a couple of ways:  
                - Use the demo data we gave you on the page.   
                - Upload a local spectrum file in *.txt format with a **200MB** limit per file.   
                
                After selecting one of the demos or uploading the file(s), several modules will be enabled on the page for further custom data process.  
                
                After processing, you can download the processed data and the baseline data if you want.  
                It is noteable that all the download links are **temporary** and will be expired when you leave the page.

                With the advances in instrumentation and sampling techniques, there is an explosive growth of data from molecular and cellular samples. 
                The call to extract more information from the large data sets has greatly challenged the conventional chemometrics method. 
                Deep learning, which utilizes very large data sets for finding hidden features therein and for making accurate predictions for a wide range of applications, 
                has been applied in an unbelievable pace in biospectroscopy and biospectral imaging in the recent 3 years. 
                In this Feature, we first introduce the background and basic knowledge of deep learning. 
                We then focus on the emerging applications of deep learning in the data preprocessing, feature detection, and modeling of the biological samples for spectral analysis and spectroscopic imaging. 
                Finally, we highlight the challenges and limitations in deep learning and the outlook for future directions.

                In spectral analysis,   spectrum-structure correlation is increasingly vital, evolving significantly in recent decades. 
                With spectrometer advancements, high-throughput detection fuels a surge in spectral data, 
                extending research from small to biomolecules across vast chemical space. Traditional chemometrics struggles to adapt to this changing landscape, 
                leading to the rapid emergence of deep learning-assisted chemometrics. 
                This approach excels at extracting latent features and making precise predictions. 
                This review introduces molecular and spectral representations alongside fundamental deep learning concepts. 
                We then outline how deep learning aids in establishing spectrum-structure correlation over the past five years, 
                facilitating spectral prediction and enabling library matching and de novo molecular generation. 
                Lastly, we address persistent challenges and potential solutions, foreseeing deep learning's rapid progress leading to definitive solutions in spectrum-structure correlation, 
                spurring advancements across disciplines.
